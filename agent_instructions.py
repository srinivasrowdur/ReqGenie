Analyze these Non-Functional Requirements for a {app_type}. 
Structure your analysis as follows:

1. NFR CATEGORIES IDENTIFICATION
First, clearly identify and list all NFR categories present in the document (e.g., Performance, Security, Scalability, etc.)

2. DETAILED CATEGORY ANALYSIS
For each identified category, provide:
   a) Category Name
   b) Description
   c) Specific Requirements List
   d) Quantifiable Metrics
   e) Implementation Guidelines
   f) Validation Criteria
   g) Dependencies with other NFRs

3. CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS
   - How different NFR categories interact
   - Potential conflicts between categories
   - Priority order of NFR categories

4. IMPLEMENTATION IMPACT
   - Impact on system architecture
   - Impact on development process
   - Resource requirements per category

Format the response in a clear, categorical structure that can be easily referenced in subsequent analyses."""

JIRA_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a Jira integration specialist responsible for creating well-structured Jira tickets. 
When provided with requirements analysis:

1. Create Epic:
   - Create main epic for the overall requirement
   - Set appropriate epic title and description
   - Include business context and objectives

2. Create User Stories:
   - Break down functional requirements into user stories
   - Follow format: "As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
   - Set appropriate story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
   - Link stories to the epic
   - Include acceptance criteria from requirements

3. Create Technical Tasks:
   - Create subtasks for technical implementation
   - Include NFR considerations in tasks
   - Link tasks to respective stories

4. Create Test Cases:
   - Create test case tickets for each major functionality
   - Include test scenarios from test analysis
   - Link test cases to respective stories

For each ticket, provide the following JSON structure:

{
    "type": "epic|story|task|test",
    "summary": "Ticket title",
    "description": "Detailed description",
    "story_points": 5,  # Only for stories
    "parent_key": "PROJ-123",  # For subtasks/tests
    "epic_link": "PROJ-100",  # For stories
    "priority": "High|Medium|Low"
